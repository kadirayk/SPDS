This includes also the fact-specific implementation which I removed from master

# SPDS

This repository contains a Java implementation of Synchronized Pushdown Systems.
Additionally, it contains an implementation of [Boomerang](boomerangPDS) and [IDEal](idealPDS) based on a Weighted Pushdown System.

# Use as Maven dependency

All projects inside this repository are pushed to GitHub's Maven repository for every release.

To include a dependency from this repository to your poject, you first have to add the repository to your pom file:


```.xml
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>de.fraunhofer.iem</groupId>
    <artifactId>WPDS</artifactId>
    <version>3.1.1</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
<repositories>
  <repository>
      <id>github</id>
      <url>https://maven.pkg.github.com/CodeShield-Security/SPDS/</url>
  </repository>
</repositories>	
```

To access the GitHub packages repository, you also need to set up GitHub credentials in your Maven's `settings.xml` file. Therefore, you need to add a `server` block with the id `github`, your username and an access token that has `package:read` rights to your `setting.xml`.
An in-depth documentation on how to do this can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/using-github-packages-with-your-projects-ecosystem/configuring-apache-maven-for-use-with-github-packages#authenticating-to-github-packages). 


# Checkout, Build and Install

To build and install SPDS into your local repository, run 

``mvn clean install -DskipTests``

in the root directory of this git repository. If you do not want to skip the test cases, remove the last flag.

# Examples

Boomerang code examples can be found [here](https://github.com/CodeShield-Security/SPDS/tree/master/boomerangPDS/src/main/java/boomerang/example). Code examples for IDEal are given [here](https://github.com/CodeShield-Security/SPDS/tree/master/idealPDS/src/main/java/inference/example).


# Notes on the Test Cases

The projects Boomerang and IDEal contain JUnit test suites. As for JUnit, the test methods are annotated with @Test and can be run as normal JUnit tests.
However, these methods are *not* executed but only statically analyzed. When one executes the JUnit tests, the test method bodies are supplied as input to Soot 
and a static analysis is triggered. All this happens in JUnit's @Before test time. The test method itself is never run, may throw NullPointerExceptions or may not even terminate.

If the static analysis succeeded, JUnit will officially label the test method as skipped. However, the test will not be labeled as Error or Failure. 
Even though the test was skipped, it succeeded. Note, JUnit outputs a message:

``org.junit.AssumptionViolatedException: got: <false>, expected: is <true>``

This is ok! The test passed!
